### Law of First Four Cards

Each card has:

* A superlative or Divine meaning.
* A comparative or Magicâ€“Astral meaning.
* A positive or Physical meaning, responding, to a transition

The general law of the four first cards is as follows:

1. Positive. Creator.
2. Negative. Reflex of the first. Preserver
3. Neuter, enveloping the two others. Transformer.
4. Passage from one series to another

## DEUS, HOMO, ROTA

God, Man, and the Universe, these are the most general principles that we can attain, and they constitute the three meanings of the first card of the Tarot

## General Septenary Key

### Example

> I wish to determine the sense of the 5th arcanum.

I look to the left and find the Hebrew letter he.

This shows that the 5th arcanum is the he of what?

In order to know, I look at the vertical column and find yod.

The 5th arcanum is the he of yod, but that is not enough, so I look at the secondary column which contains the sign (â€“) negative.

The fifth card of the Tarot isâ€”_<mark style="color:blue;">The He of Yod considered negatively</mark>_
